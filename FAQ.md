# Warnable v3 | Frequently Asked Questions

## 'Is there a already hosted version of this bot?'
No... This is intended for you to clone, setup and host yourself. Hopefully I made it easy enough to... ðŸ¤ž

Why?
After maintaing a public bot for aprox 4 years, the amount of maintaining required has unmotivated me. Especially during my university course, it'll put stress on me.
With a team, it could be possible. There have been ideas I've put aside because I didn't want to make something that is DIY too complicated.

**Look through the [previous issues](https://github.com/zacimac/warnable/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) or [create a new issue](https://github.com/zacimac/warnable/issues/new) for help if needed.**

## 'How many servers can this bot be used in?'
Unlimited... But, it is not exactly designed for public use. Each time a new server needs to be setup, the bot owner must edit the `servers.json` file. 

**FYI**, any time the `servers.json` file is edited, there is no need for the bot to be restarted! It will reload the new settings by itself!

**^^ THIS IS CHANGING!!**
