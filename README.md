## What is Warnable?
Warnable makes moderation tracking easy! Allowing Discord server moderators to apply warnings to a point based warning database. Warnable will handle punishments to members and will even unmute or unban the member if set as a temporary punishment!
<br />Along with some extra moderation tools, such as **Automod** (Discord invites and bad words! | Auto warn support | Immune role and specific exceptions too!), prune and manual punishments!

Check out the [commands](./Commands.md) (GIF demos included!)
